# Phoenix Senior Assasin

Couple of python scripts that made organizing the Class of 2022's senior assasin much easiser. 

Purpose of the scripts
- Automatically matches random targets to the players stil alive in the game
- Ensures that the organizers do not have an unfair advantage
- Automates the weekly communication between the organizers and the participants
- Makes the tracking of eliminations and alive players much easiser
